# Notes to get started with sky130 pdk
These are my personal notes that I have accumulated during my fist project with foss tools using Skywater sky 130 PDK and efabless.

There are two alternatives:
[Open Shuttle progam](https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program) that is free
[Chip ignite](https://efabless.com/) that has 4 yearly tapeout dates.
